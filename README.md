Stack is a cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects. It is intended for Haskellers both new and experienced.

See [haskellstack.org](http://haskellstack.org) or the [doc](./doc) directory for more
information.

### Subsystem maintainers

* GHCJS - [Matchwood](https://github.com/matchwood)

NOTE: GHCJS support is considered experimental. In Stack 2.0, we are
removing support for building GHCJS itself; links will be added to
this README for information on separate tools. Issues on GHCJS may be
closed as not supported, and the next major Stack release may remove
GHCJS support entirely.
