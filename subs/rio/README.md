# The rio library

*A standard library for Haskell*

![Rio](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fc162fb0024699c85f00eae769085a5fe528153e/68747470733a2f2f7777772e61687374617469632e636f6d2f70686f746f732f636974792f76692d76363837315f30305f31343030783434322e6a7067)

__NOTE__ This code is currently in prerelease status, and has been
released as a tech preview. A number of us are actively working on
improving the project and getting it to a useful first release. For
more information, see the
[description of goals](https://github.com/snoyberg/codename-karka#readme)
and the
[issue tracker for discussions](https://github.com/snoyberg/codename-karka/issues).

The goal of the `rio` library is to help you jump start your Haskell
coding. It is intended as a cross between:

* Useful `Prelude` replacement
* Collection of well designed, trusted libraries
* A set of best practices for writing production quality Haskell code

You're free to use any subset of functionality desired in your
project. This README will guide you through using `rio` to its fullest
extent.

*FIXME* Totally incomplete
